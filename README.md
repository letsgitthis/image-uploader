## Description
### A small example for uploading images from your computers file storage and placing it into an upload directory. 
    
## Installation
### Download or use the git clone command. Be sure to npm install the listed dependencies.
    
## Usage
### The idea is to take the object parameters of the uploaded image and send that information to the database, while the image itself is stored in a directory. This is meant for beginner projects that avoid binary (BLOB)
